											<h3>Qui sommes nous ?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Our license degree project is on connected greenhouses. Several fruit and vegetable greenhouses have been set up in several districts of Paris in order to overcome food insecurity. To do, Megdouda CHEBAH and Sofiane KARAR are developing NETFOOD, a mobile application that can make these greenhouses connected for considerable productivity, at an affordable price and a better follow-up from the people who will be subscribed to it.A network of connected greenhouses will then be formed. Hence the : Net. As for "food", it means "Food" in English.</p>
										<p>Our target audience is divided into three parts in society, the first and second one are the subscribers who wish to participate in the maintenance of greenhouses, the first on a voluntary basis and the other not.finally, the third one who are the most deprived who will be able to subscribe to our
										application for free. At the end of each month, Netfood benefits to our subscribers the opportunity to currently enjoy a considerable variety of fruits and vegetables harvest. </p>
										<p>The particularity of our application is that it manages the maintenance of the greenhouse itself, in just a few clicks you can manage temperature, air, water, light, etc. so anyone could use it.
										The main goal of NetFood is to enable every family to become food self-sufficient. We are counting on you to join us, to take up this challenge together!</p>
